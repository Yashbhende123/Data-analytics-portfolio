📊 Project Title: Equality Score Classification Across Daikibo Factories
📝 Project Summary
In this project, I analyzed job roles across multiple Daikibo factories to evaluate workplace equality. Using a custom scoring system, I assigned an Equality Score to each role and classified them into categories such as Highly Discriminative, Unfair, Fair, and Highly Fair. This helps identify patterns of inequality across organizational levels and locations.
